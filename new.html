<h1><u>About US:</u></h1><h2>
Sherlock Holmes  is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur <br> Conan Doyle.
 Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, <br> Holmes is known for his
 proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic <br>science and logical reasoning
borders on the fantastic, which he employs <br> when investigating cases for a wide variety
of clients, including Scotland Yard. <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, <br>the character's popularity became widespread
with the first series of short <br>stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "AScandal in Bohemia" <br>
 in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually four <br> novels and 56 short
stories. All but one[a] are set in the Victorian or <br> Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most
are narrated <br> by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson <br>
Holmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of <br>stimulating cases.
 He sometimes used morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter <br> of which he injects in a seven-percent
  solution; both drugs were legal in <br> 19th-century England. As a physician, Watson strongly
  disapproves of his  <br>friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's only vice, and concerned <br>
  about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect.
